# 2017 International WFTDA Championship Tournament Analysis

The purpose of this repo was to examine the impact of penalties on the score of any particular jam. While the [WFTDA Stats Repository](https://stats-repo.wftda.com/bout.jsp?boutId=1455) supplies stats about how players did, it's hard to get a whole game perspective.

The goal of this project was to analyize player performance in the Denver vs. Gotham game in the 2017 International WFTDA Championship Tournament.

## Setup:

1. Clone the repo.
1. Open IDLE.
1. Use IDLE to open any of the .py files in this repo.
1. Select Run Module from the Run menu.
1. Revel in the glory of the stats and graphs!
